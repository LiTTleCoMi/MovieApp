        This app is required to run on a server!

        Setting up a local server:
            Using Live Server Extension in VSCode (Visual Studio Code):
                Install VSCode (if you don't have it already) from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
                Install the Live Server extension:
                    - Open VS Code, go to the Extensions panel, search for Live Server, and install it.
                Open your project folder in VS Code:
                    - Open the folder containing your app files by selecting File > Open Folder in VS Code.
                Launch Live Server:
                    - Right-click on your index.html (or main file) and select Open with Live Server.
                    - Alternatively, click on the Go Live button at the bottom-right corner of VS Code.
                    - This will launch a local server at http://localhost:5500 (by default).

            Using Node.js:
                - Install Node.js and npm (if you haven't already) from https://nodejs.org.
                - Install http-server globally (via npm):
                    - npm install -g http-server
                - Navigate to the app directory:
                    - cd /path/to/the/app.
                - Start the server:
                    - http-server
                This will start a local server at http://localhost:8080 (or another available port).
        
    On the web:
        - Go to https://littlecomi.github.io/MovieApp/src/index.html.

!IMPORTANT!
    Make sure you are in the directory src/<file.html> instead of just src/
